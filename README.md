# üìö BookBot - Text Analysis Tool

BookBot is a command-line text analysis tool that processes books (text files) and generates reports on word count and letter frequency. Built as part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) curriculum.

## üß† Concepts Learned

### Core Python Programming

- **File I/O Operations**: Reading text files (`open()`, `read()`), handling relative file paths
- **String Manipulation**: Case normalization (`.lower()`), character filtering (`isalpha()`), splitting text into words (`split()`)
- **Data Structures**: Dictionaries for tracking letter frequencies, converting dictionaries to sorted lists
- **Control Flow**: Loops (`for`, `while`), conditional logic (`if`/`elif`/`else`), function definitions
- **Data Processing**: Word counting, character frequency analysis, sorting results (`sorted()` + lambda functions)
- **Error Handling**: Basic exception handling (e.g., file not found)
- **Command-Line Execution**: Using `sys.argv`, script execution flow (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide a `.txt` file path (e.g., `books/frankenstein.txt`)
2. **Processing**:
   - Extracts text and converts to lowercase
   - Splits text into words
   - Counts occurrences of each letter (a-z)
3. **Output**: Prints:
   - Total word count
   - Sorted letter frequencies (descending order)
   - Visual histogram of letter usage
